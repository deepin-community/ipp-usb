ipp-usb (0.9.17-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  ipp-usb uses the IPP-over-USB protocol to allow the setting up of a
  driverless print queue for most USB connected modern multi-function
  and a few modern USB-only devices. The default is to auto-setup the
  queue with cups-browsed.

  Existing or newly created queues on a USB connection for IPP-over-USB
  capable devices using vendor drivers will not work while the ipp-usb
  service is activated and managing the connection. Details are at
